Prevention methods include gathering intelligence data on the latest threats, threat actors, and their [TTPs ](https://www.optiv.com/explore-optiv-insights/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence)[(Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)](https://www.optiv.com/explore-optiv-insights/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence).

#### Monitoring and Investigation

SOC team proactively uses [SIEM (Security information and event management) ](https://www.fireeye.com/products/helix/what-is-siem-and-how-does-it-work.html)and[ EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-endpoint-detection-and-response.html) tools to monitor suspicious and malicious network activities. Imagine being a firefighter and having a multi-alarm fire - one-alarm fires, two-alarm fires, three-alarm fires; the categories classify the seriousness of the fire, which is a threat in our case. As a Security Analyst, you will learn how to prioritise the alerts based on their level: Low, Medium, High, and Critical.

#### Response

After the investigation, the SOC team coordinates and takes action on the compromised hosts, which involves isolating the hosts from the network, terminating the malicious processes, deleting files, and more.
